https://advanced-stock-market.herokuapp.com/api-docs/

Heroku does not provide free hosting for Mongodb[Free for PostgreSQL], you can host on https://cloud.mongodb.com/.

NodeJs with Express can be hosted for free on Heroku App.

I used this template for trying new features, libs and for quick prototype.
